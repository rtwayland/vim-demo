/* Repeat */

// The "." (period/dot) command will "repeat" the last action you performed.

// Use the "r," command on the semicolon on line 7 to replace it with a comma
// Then go to the end of each subsequent line and simply use the "." command to execute the same action
const ob = {
  one: 1;
  two: 2;
  three: 3;
  four: 4;
  five: 5;

// With your cursor over the "t" of "text", use the "v" command to select that character.
// Then use the "U" (shift + u) command to make the character uppercase.
const settext = () => {};

// With your cursor over the "v" of "value", use the "." command to repeat the "uppercase" action you previously performed.
